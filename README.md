# **EcoNear - Google Solution Challenge**


The "EcoNear" project aims to create awareness about waste management and recycling by promoting climate action and responsible production and consumption. Approximately 2.01 billion tons of urban solid waste is generated worldwide each year, with at least a third of it not being managed in an environmentally sustainable manner. This situation not only damages ecosystems but also leads to water and soil pollution, reduces biodiversity, and has a direct link to climate change. To address this serious threat, our platform has been developed to raise awareness about household waste, taking a significant step towards a sustainableÂ future.One of the primary goals of our project is to enable every individual to distinguish between recyclable and non-recyclable waste and to direct this waste to the appropriate recycling bins. To encourage this process, we provide our users with the opportunity to earn a financial reward for each unit of recycled waste. By promoting the reuse of recyclable materials, we aim to contribute to the development of a sustainable environmentalÂ awareness.

This platform provides detailed information specific to each type of waste, enabling us to better understand the damage that waste causes to the environment. In this way, we can gain a comprehensive awareness of waste management and its environmental impact, while at the same time developing behaviors appropriate to the unique characteristics of each type of waste. Such an approach guides us in the proper segregation and treatment of waste, taking an important step towards a more sustainable and responsibleÂ society.  ![AdsÄ±z tasarÄ±m](https://github.com/burakbaslik/econear_app/assets/88744471/4427b4aa-21d5-4957-95f1-a75eb2d0dcd3)

# **ðŸ’»ECONEAR RECYCLE :**





Our advanced recycling system makes it easy for users to sort their waste by type. We have multiple recycling bins, each customized for different types of waste (electronics, plastic, paper, etc.). After selecting the appropriate bin for their waste, users log in by entering their ID and drop their waste in the relevant bin. After depositing the waste, the user receives a financial reward based on the weight of the waste deposited. This system encourages waste segregation, making recycling processes both efficientÂ andÂ rewarding.

# **ðŸ’» TECHNOLOGIES WE USE :**



We chose Flutter for cross-platform user interface development and Firebase database for storing user data. We added Google Maps locations so that our users can easily find the collection sites. The integration of these technologies aims to provide our users with a seamless, interactive and knowledge-basedÂ experience.
